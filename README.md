# PyCaptive

### A Captive Portal written in Python (and Flask).

The purposeS of this application are:

- to provide an interface capable to perform authentication of users who want to gain access to the Internet via a open Access Point
- to maintain a database and history of authenticated users and IP addresses
- to update ACL files used by Squid Proxy

Although this application could not be a hundred percent scalable, when it comes to adapt to other solutions, the idea and the workflow could be adapted. So, feel free to fork and make your own customizations, respecting the license which rules on this project.


Thank you,
