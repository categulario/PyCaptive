- Python, Flask, MongoDB, [and...](https://github.com/ivanlmj/PyCaptive/blob/master/requirements.txt)


### Notice

PyCaptive requires a server properly configured as Router, with a Proxy Server in Transparent Mode. 

That means: without these two solutions properly configured, **PyCaptive will not work**.

A extra documentation for further orientation will be provided. For more information, have a look on the [issues](https://github.com/ivanlmj/PyCaptive/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aall).
