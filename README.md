# PyCaptive

A Captive Portal written in Python (and Flask).


### Purpose

To provide an authentication service for Tranparent Proxies on Wired + Wireless networks.


### Status

Under Development.


### Made Of

Python, Flask, MongoDB, [...](https://github.com/ivanlmj/PyCaptive/blob/master/requirements.txt)


### Notice

PyCaptive requires a server properly configured as Router, with a Proxy Server in Transparent Mode. 

That means: 
- without these two solutions properly configured, **PyCaptive will not work**.

A extra documentation for further orientation will be provided. For more information, have a look on the [issues](https://github.com/ivanlmj/PyCaptive/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aall).
