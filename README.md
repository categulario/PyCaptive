# PyCaptive

A Captive Portal written in Python (and Flask).


### Purpose

To provide authentication service for Tranparent Proxies.


### Notice

This application requires a server properly configured as router, with a proxy server 
configured in transparent mode. 

That means, if you don't have these two solutions properly configured, **PyCaptive will not work.**

A document will be provided in order to help with setup of a Firewall + Proxy (Transparent Mode).

See the [Issue Tracking of PyCaptive](https://trello.com/b/u1cGtOD9/pycaptive) for more information about Improvements, Bugs and other topics.
