# PyCaptive

A Captive Portal written in Python (and Flask).


### Purpose

To provide authentication service for Tranparent Proxies.


### Notice

This application requires a server properly configured as router, with a proxy server 
configured as transparent mode. After having these two configurations, you'll be able to use this solution.


### Status

Under Development (almost done...)


### Main Technologies

- Flask v0.12.2
- PyMongo v3.5.1


### Issue Tracking (Improvements and Bugs)
